Here are the steps to locally run the React dashboard application:

Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from Node.js official website.
npm: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js. You can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Steps to Run the Application Locally
Clone the Repository

If the code is hosted on a GitHub repository, clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Alternatively, if you have the project in a ZIP file, unzip it and navigate to the unzipped directory.

Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file, including React, Redux, and any other dependencies required for the project.

Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the application, and it should automatically open a new tab in your default web browser, pointing to http://localhost:3000.

If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Interact with the Application

Adding a Widget: Use the "+Add Widget" section to add a new widget to a selected category.
Removing a Widget: Click the cross (Ã—) icon on any widget to remove it from the category.
View Widgets: You can view the dynamically added widgets in their respective categories.
Stop the Development Server

To stop the development server, go back to your terminal where it's running and press Ctrl + C.

Optional: Build the Application for Production
If you want to create a production build of the application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will generate a build folder with optimized files for production, which you can deploy to a web server.

Troubleshooting
Port Conflicts: If http://localhost:3000 is already in use, you may be prompted to use a different port. You can confirm by pressing Y.
Missing Dependencies: If you encounter any issues related to missing dependencies, ensure that you have correctly installed all required packages by re-running npm install.
These steps should allow you to run the application locally and start working with it right away.
